# Trader Leaderboard API

## Overview

This is a simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express that manages trader scores and generates a dynamic leaderboard. It supports JWT-based authentication and an in-memory caching layer for efficient leaderboard fetching.

## Features

* Add or update trader scores (only if the new score is higher).
* Retrieve the top 10 traders by score.
* Fetch individual trader rank and score.
* JWT-based authentication for secure endpoints.
* In-memory caching of leaderboard to improve performance.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd trader-leaderboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with content similar to:

   ```
   PORT=3000
   DB_PATH=./leaderboard.db
   JWT_SECRET=MySecureKey_456!
   REQUIRE_AUTH=true
   LEADERBOARD_CACHE_TTL_MS=30000
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
